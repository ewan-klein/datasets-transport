# Transport related data

This repository has been forked from the [Edinburgh Council transport datasets](https://github.com/edinburghcouncil/datasets-transport) repository. The main modification involves:

* aggregating the `accident.csv` files for separate years in `Collision Data` into a single file (`accident-2010-13.csv`), and
* supplementing this new file with latitude-longitude coordinates (`accident-2010-13-geocoded.csv`).


See  [Edinburgh Council datasets](https://github.com/edinburghcouncil)  for licencing details, contribution guidelines and other further information.
